      "fullResponse": "PARABLE: The Lost Sheep (Luke 15:3-7)\n\n📖 The Story (Brief Retelling)\nA shepherd has 100 sheep, but one wanders away. He leaves the 99 in safety and searches everywhere for the lost one. When he finds it, he celebrates with joy and calls his friends to rejoice with him.\n\n👥 Original Audience & Context\nJesus told this to Pharisees and teachers who criticized Him for eating with tax collectors and sinners. They believed God only cared about \"righteous\" people, not outcasts.\n\n🎯 Core Spiritual Lesson\nGod actively pursues every lost person with relentless love. Heaven rejoices more over one sinner who repents than 99 people who don't need repentance. No one is too far gone for God's grace.\n\n🌍 Modern-Day Example\nLike a parent who stays up all night searching for a missing child, or a teacher who gives extra attention to a struggling student. God doesn't write anyone off - He pursues the lost, broken, and forgotten with the same intensity."
